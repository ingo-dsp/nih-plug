/// Create an [`Editor`] instance using a [`vizia`][::vizia] GUI. The [`ViziaState`] passed to this
/// function contains the GUI's intitial size, and this is kept in sync whenever the GUI gets
/// resized. You can also use this to know if the GUI is open, so you can avoid performing
/// potentially expensive calculations while the GUI is not open. If you want this size to be
/// persisted when restoring a plugin instance, then you can store it in a `#[persist = "key"]`
/// field on your parameters struct.
///
/// The [`GuiContext`] is also passed to the app function. This is only meant for saving and
/// restoring state as part of your plugin's preset handling. You should not interact with this
/// directly to set parameters. Use the `ParamEvent`s instead.
///
/// The `theming` argument controls what level of theming to apply. If you use
/// [`ViziaTheming::Custom`], then you **need** to call
/// [`nih_plug_vizia::assets::register_noto_sans_light()`][assets::register_noto_sans_light()] at
/// the start of your app function. Vizia's included fonts are also not registered by default. If
/// you use the Roboto font that normally comes with Vizia or any of its emoji or icon fonts, you
/// also need to register those using the functions in
/// [`nih_plug_vizia::vizia_assets`][crate::vizia_assets].
///
/// See [VIZIA](https://github.com/vizia/vizia)'s repository for examples on how to use this.
